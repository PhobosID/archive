To Modify the Website Content, You need to modify the .HTML file.

To Modify the look or styling the Website, kindly modify the `style.css` in the CSS Folder.

Modifying `404.html`     and `404.css` is not recommended.

Also Modifying the `script.js` or any JS file is generally not recommended, as it will potentially 'broke' the website.

Leave the Lib Folder alone, it is a library and you MUST NOT Modify that.
